# Behavioural_Cloning

This is my solution to the third project in [Udacity's SDCND](https://eu.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).

Use the following command to activate autonomous mode using my model, then select autonomous mode in Udacity's simulator.

    python drive.py model_6_2.h5

You can also watch my recording of an autonomous lap (run.mp4), and the first 5 seconds of the features identified at the 2nd convolutional layer (run_hidden.mp4).
